Directory layout on openwrt, SIMETBOX version.  Most/all of the
files are actually provided by the simet-ma package, but we hardcode
their paths in several places inside the simet-lmapd package.

/usr/lib/simet/
   + lmap-default-schedule.json  (default measurement schedule at boot)

/usr/lib/simet/lmap/config.d/
   +  simetbox.json... (hardcoded internal tasks)
   +  simet-ma.json [simet-ma tasks]

/usr/lib/simet/lmap/registry.d/
   +  simetbox.json... (hardcoded internal utilities)
   +  simet-ma.json [simet-ma tasks]
   +  ...

/etc/simet/lmap/
   + lmap-agent.json     (agent-id -- created on register by simet-ma)
   + lmap-group.json     (group-id -- not implemented yet)
   + ...

/var/run/lmapd/
   + lmap-schedule.json  (test schedule) -- may ship an uci-default, download from controller
